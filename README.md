- Do the same thing above using a dictionary. Prove that namedtuple is faster. - 250 (including 5 test cases)
- Create fake data (you can use Faker for company names) for imaginary  stock exchange for top 100 companies (name, symbol, open, high, close).  Assign a random weight to all the companies. Calculate and show what  value the stock market started at, what was the highest value during the  day, and where did it end. Make sure your open, high, close are not  totally random. You can only use namedtuple. - 500  (including 10 test  cases)
- Once done, share a public link to your repo where we can find the  notebook, python files, readme file, and GitHub Actions executed.
